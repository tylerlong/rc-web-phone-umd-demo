# RingCentral Web Phone UMD demo

This is a demo to use RingCentral Web Phone for browser. Just in case you don't
want to use any bundling tools such as webpack.

It could be as simple as:

```html
<script
  src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/ringcentral-web-phone@2.1.5/dist/esm/index.umd.js"
></script>
```
